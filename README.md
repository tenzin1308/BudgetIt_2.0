# Budget It 2.0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Idea

Concept was to develop an application which allows people to manage their money more tightly to save more by seeing where in their vicinity, the cheapest produce they typed in was. Also, shows the prices of the produce of that supermarket.\
At the end of the CUNY Start-up Baruch 2019 hackathon, this project was working but there were too many flaws and bugs (also, this was created using JavaFX). Thus, After the hackathon in order to finalize this project, a friend and I reimplemented the whole project into a web application using React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, there are two sides, the client and server side you can run.
After directing to both sides on different terminals, you can run by using the following code:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) & [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

The client page(3000) will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
